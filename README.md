# 52I - Airport Rework

Some of the smaller airports in MSFS 2020 aren't quite as accurate as they could be.
This is a mild rework of the runway and parking area of 52I.

The real airport has edge lights which are not in the stock game.
Added them here, as well as adjusted the grass coloring to make it stand out a bit more and be a bit more obvious.
